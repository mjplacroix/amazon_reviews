1) [pandas_feather_benchmark](https://github.com/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/pandas_feather_benchmark.ipynb) - a progressively scaled benchmarking comparison of `feather-format` VS `pd.read_csv` and `.apply` VS pandas `datetime`
2) [Time_Analysis](https://github.com/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/time_analysis.ipynb) - a time based analysis of several product catagories to discover any trends across annual, monthly, or weekly reviews
3) [Review_Timing](https://github.com/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/review_timing.ipynb) - comparing across a series of time increments (day of week, day of month, and monthly) the average rating
