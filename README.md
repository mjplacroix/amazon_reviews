# Amazon Reviews Analysis

[This Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/visual_data_analysis.ipynb) is a visual data analysis investigating a handful of correlations across product categories in [this dataset](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html) of 230 million Amazon reviews. 


The following are a series of draft notebook I used for EDA (exploratory data analysis). Many pieces of the functions in the above notebook were drafted in these. 

1) [pandas_feather_benchmark](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/pandas_feather_benchmark.ipynb) - a progressively scaled benchmarking comparison of `feather-format` VS `pd.read_csv` and `.apply` VS pandas `datetime`
2) [Time_Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/time_analysis.ipynb) - a time based analysis of several product catagories to discover any trends across annual, monthly, or weekly reviews
3) [Review_Timing](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/review_timing.ipynb) - comparing across a series of time increments (day of week, day of month, and monthly) the average rating
4) [Word_Count](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mjplacroix/amazon_reviews/blob/master/word_count_analysis.ipynb) - comparing common language in reviews across several catagories, included an analysis of top words
